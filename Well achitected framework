Well Architected Framework:

* Are you well Architected ??

** Well Architected Framework provides customers with prescriptive advice on how to build and operate a cloud native architecture.
** It contains a set of questions you can use to measure your architecture against best practices.
** General Design Guidelines:
      # Stop guessing your capacity needs
      # Test systems at production scale
      # Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
      # Allow for evolutionary architectures
      # Drive architectures using data
      # Improve through game days

** Are you Well Architected around these 5 pillars?
      # Operational Excellence
          Perform operations as code
          Annotate documentation
          Make frequent, small, reversible changes
          Refine operations procedures frequently
          Anticipate failure
          Learn from all operational failures

      # Security
          Implement a strong identity foundation
          Enable traceability
          Apply security at all layers
          Automate security best practices
          Protect data in transit and at rest
          Keep people away from data
          Prepare for security events

      # Reliability
          Test recovery procedures
          Automatically recover from failure
          Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
          Stop guessing capacity
          Manage change in automation

      # Performance Efficiency
          Democratize advanced technologies
          Go global in minutes
          Use serverless architectures
          Experiment more often
          Mechanical sympathy (You force a particular technology to work as you want and you hope they get the performance that we need, rather use the right technology for the right thing instead of bending it to your will )

      # Cost Optimisation
          Adopt a consumption model
          Measure overall efficiency
          Stop spending money on data center operations
          Analyze and attribute expenditure
          Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership

** Intent of reviews through these 46 questions:
      # NOT an Audit - Work together to Improve
      # NOT architecture astronauts - Pragmatic Proven Advice
      # NOT a one time check - Throughout Lifecycle
